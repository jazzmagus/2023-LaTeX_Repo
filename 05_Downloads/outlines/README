The "outlines" package
----------------------
v 1.1, Charles Pecheur, January 23, 2012


The "outlines" package defines the "outline" environment,
that allows outline-style indented lists with freely mixed levels up
to four levels deep.  It replaces the nested "begin"/"end" pairs by
different item tags "\1" to "\4" for each nesting level.  This is very
convenient in cases where nested lists are used a lot, such as for to-do
lists or presentation slides.

This package is built on top of the standard list environments and has 
no specific pre-requisite.
