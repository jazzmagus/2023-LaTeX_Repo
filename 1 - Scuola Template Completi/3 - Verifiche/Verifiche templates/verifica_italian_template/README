This LaTeX document class is intended for teachers who must write 
out the text of a test or an exam. It provides various environments 
and commands to produce the typical exercises contained in this 
kind of document. It is mainly intended for Italian high school
teachers, as the style is probably more in line with Italian high 
school tests. For this reason the documentation is mainly written 
in Italian.
