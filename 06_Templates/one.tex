\byline{Geek Designs New \LaTeX{} Package}{Matthew Allen}

The package is basically a redefinition of the \verb+\maketitle+ command.  The model was the New York Times---hopefully I haven't violated any copyright laws.  I also had to redefine the plain pagestyle.  It kept me busy for a few nights after work.  The rest is packages other people have written.      

\begin{window}[2,r,\includegraphics[width=1in]{atom.jpg},\centerline{\footnotesize{The Atom}}] The \verb+multicol+ package allows using multiple columns without starting a new page.  Using floats is not possible in a columns environment, however with the \verb+picinpar+ package, I can set a picture inside a block of text---just like you one you see here.  Isn't \LaTeX{} cool?
And now we're just filling more space, and yet more space.

\headline{Another Headline}
This is just an example to fill up some space, but as long as I have your attention, I'll give some newspaper advice.

I suppose we could also show how an equation is type set:
\begin{displaymath}
x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}
\end{displaymath}
and there you have it.
