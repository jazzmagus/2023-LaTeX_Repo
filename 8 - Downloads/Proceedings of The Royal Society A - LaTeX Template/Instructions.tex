\section{Instructions for RS \LaTeX\ Template}

This latex class file is available for authors to prepare the manuscript for the Royal Society journals.
It is assumed that the authors are familiar with either plain \TeX, \LaTeX,\ \AmS-\TeX\ or a standard latex set-up,
hence only the essential points are described in this document. For more details please see the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}
or \textit{The not so short introduction to \LaTeXe}.

\section{Installation}
Within the supplied set of files, \texttt{rsproca\_new.cls} need to be copied into a directory
where tex looks for input files. The other files need to be kept as a reference while preparing your manuscript.
Please use pre-defined commands from \texttt{RSPA\_Author\_tex.tex} for title, authors, address, abstract, keywords, body etc.

\section{How to start using rsproca\_new.cls}
Before you type anything that actually appears in the paper you need to include a \verb+\documentclass{rsproca_new}+ command
at the very beginning and then, the two commands that have to be part of any latex document, \verb+\begin{document}+
at the start and the \verb+\end{document}+ at the end of your paper. The main structure of your document should be as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
\documentclass{rsproca_new}
\begin{document}
\title{...}
\author{....}
\address{...}
\subject{...}
\keywords{...}
\corres{...}

\begin{abstract}
..........
..........
\end{abstract}

\begin{fmtext}
............
\end{fmtext}

\maketitle
....
\section{....}
...
\subsection{....}
....
\end{document}
\end{verbatim}

Note: In order to insert few lines on first page use the command \verb+\begin{fmtext}....\end{fmtext}+ before \verb+\maketitle+ command.
Please look into sample.tex for more clarification.

\section{Preamble}

In the preamble portion i.e. before \verb+\begin{document}+ insert the respective journal name:
\verb+\jname{rspa}+ and \verb+\Journal{Proc R Soc A\ }+ to get journal name in running heads.
