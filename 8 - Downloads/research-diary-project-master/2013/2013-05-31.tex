\section*{Example entry }

This example entry was created by executing the "add\_entry" shell script from the top level directory of this github repository. This shell script created the 2013 directory as well as this file. Each time the script is executed, it checks to see if there exists a directory for the current year. If not, the directory is created. Then the script creates a TeX file with today's date as the filename. It is designed so that there can exist one try for each day.

The script also softlinks the style file and some other scripts into the YEAR directory to make these available from the same directory.
