		The Console in Latexian allows you to see the results of all Preview, Live Preview, and Export operations that are performed. The Console can be accessed by selecting "Console" from the "Window" menu. The Console window shows a list of operations along the left side, with the most recent operations appearing at the top. The list includes a status of "Completed" or "Failure" for operations that are not running; operations in progress can be terminated with by clicking the "X" button.<br/><br/>
		The right-side of the Console lists the tasks for the selected operation, including the commands executed and output produced by those commands. For a currently executing command, the output text area is interactive; it accepts keyboard input and sends it to the command to be processed. Most commands that Latexian executes do not require any input from the user, with the notable exception being <a href="export.html">Latexian's Export feature</a>, which may require input when unrecognized LaTeX commands are encountered.
