		Installing Latexian is as simple as a drag and drop. Just follow these steps:
		<ul>
			<li><a href="http://tacosw.com/latexian/download.php">Download Latexian</a> from the Taco Software website. The file that you download will be called Latexian.zip.</li>
			<li>Once the download is complete, double-click the Latexian.zip file to decompress it. After decompression, a folder will appear that is named Latexian.</li>
			<li>Within the Latexian folder, you will find the application. Drag it to your Applications folder.</li>
		</ul><br/>
		The Preview and Export functionality in Latexian requires that you have the MacTeX or BasicTeX (2009 or later) distribution installed. Both of these can be downloaded from the <a href="http://tacosw.com/latexian/mactex.php">MacTeX website</a>.
