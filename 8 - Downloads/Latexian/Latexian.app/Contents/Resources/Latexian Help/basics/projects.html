			In Latexian, creating a project simply means selecting the folder that contains your project's documents. Select "Open Project Folder..." from the "File" menu.

			Recent projects can be accessed by looking under "Open Recent Project" in the "File" menu. If you don't see the project that your looking for, remember that you can just follow the steps in <a href="#newproject">"Creating a New Project"</a> to get started in seconds.

				A Project Window</a>
			</div>
			When you open a project, you will see a file browser on the left hand side of the project window. This file browser allows you to 
			select files to edit. If you are using a tabbed interface for your project (a setting in the Preferences), then double-click a file
			to open it in a new tab. If you are not using tabs, then simply selecting the file will open it.<br /><br />
			Sometimes, it may be difficult to find the file you're seeking in a project, especially when you have many folders. In cases like this, 
			you may consider using Latexian's <a href="documents.html#openquickly">Open Quickly</a> feature to quickly search for a file by 
			its name.<br /><br />
			The file browser supports drag-and-drop for files and folders. You can drag files within a project, or between a project and the Finder.

				The Action Menu</a>
			</div>
			The Action Menu allows you to perform common file operations like saving, renaming, and deleting files. It also allows you to Preview a
			document in a PDF viewer, and show Live Preview. When you select a command from the Action Menu, the command is applied to the file
			currently selected in the file browser, which may differ from the file that you are currently editing. The commands in the Action Menu
			can also be accessed by right-clicking (or control-clicking) a file in the file browser.
