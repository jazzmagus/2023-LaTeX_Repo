		<div class="subsectioncontent">
			Latexian is designed to run natively on Mac OS X Lion, using many of the new features that Lion makes available to apps. These new features are described below.

			Mac OS X Lion introduces autosave for document-based apps. Autosave means that changes to your documents are automatically saved as you edit them; there is no longer a need to manually save documents! With Autosave, the "Save" command only appears in the File menu for Untitled documents. For other documents, "Save a Version" appears (see <a href="#versions">Versions</a> for more information). "Save As..." has been replaced with the "Duplicate" command, to duplicate the contents of a document in a new, untitled document. Because documents are automatically saved with Autosave, there are no longer unsaved document indicators in the tab and window close buttons, and in the project file browser. With Autosave and Resume, untitled documents are saved by the app and restored when the app is re-opened.

		<div class="subsectiontitle"><a name="resume"/>Resume</div>
			With Resume in Mac OS X Lion, an app automatically returns to its previous state after quitting and re-opening it. In Latexian, this means that document and project windows are restored (including open tabs), Component Library windows are restored, and utility windows like Preferences and Batch Find are restored. Resume can be enabled or disabled in the Appearance pane of System Preferences. Hold the "option" key when quitting to obtain the non-default Resume behavior (i.e. use Resume when it is disabled in System Preferences, or don't use Resume when it is enabled).

				Versions in Mac OS X Lion</a>
			</div>
			Versions allows you to review past iterations of a document, so you can see what changes have been made, and restore an older version of a document when desired. To access Versions, open the arrow that appears next to the document name in window titlebar, and select "Browse All Versions". You will see a timeline showing the version history of the selected document. Latexian supports using Live Preview to see how previous versions of an HTML document rendered.

		<div class="subsectiontitle"><a name="fullscreen"/>Full Screen</div>
		<div class="subsectioncontent">
			Latexian has support for using a Full Screen interface in Mac OS X Lion. Just click the Full Screen icon that appears in the top-right corner of a document window. When in Full Screen you can use touch gestures (with a Magic Mouse or touchpad) to switch between windows. Move the mouse to the top of the screen to access the Main Menu of Latexian. From the main menu with Full Screen activated, the Full Screen icon appears on the right side to exit Full Screen mode.
