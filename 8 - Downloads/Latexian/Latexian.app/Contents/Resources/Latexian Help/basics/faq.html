		<div class="subsectioncontent">
			LaTeX is a language used for typesetting documents, including journal articles and books, most commonly used for technical and scientific publications. Latexian provides tools that assist in the process of creating an LaTeX document. These tools include syntax-aware spell checking, and Live Preview, which allows you to see typesetting results while you edit your document. If you need to learn LaTeX, <a href="http://www.andy-roberts.net/misc/latex/">here is a useful tutorial</a> to help you get started.

		<div class="subsectiontitle"><a name="install"/>How do I install Latexian?</div>
		<div class="subsectioncontent">
			Installing Latexian is as simple as a drag and drop. Just follow these steps:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="http://tacosw.com/latexian/download.php">Download Latexian</a> from the Taco Software website. The file that you download will be called Latexian.zip.</li>
				<li>Once the download is complete, double-click the Latexian.zip file to decompress it. After decompression, a folder will appear that is named Latexian.</li>
				<li>Within the Latexian folder, you will find the application. Drag it to your Applications folder.</li>
			</ul><br/>
		The Preview and Export functionality in Latexian requires that you have the MacTeX-2009 or BasicTeX-2009 distribution installed. Both of these can be downloaded from the <a href="http://tacosw.com/latexian/mactex.php">MacTeX website</a>.

		<div class="subsectiontitle"><a name="feature"/>Latexian doesn't have a feature that I want. What should I do?</div>
		<div class="subsectioncontent">
			If there is a feature that you would like to see in Latexian, feel free to <a href="support.html">contact Taco Software support</a> and let us know about it. Frequently, feature requests give us great ideas for how to improve the product.

		<div class="subsectiontitle"><a name="lostlicense"/>I have lost my Latexian license code. How can I recover it?</div>
		<div class="subsectioncontent">
			To recover your license code, visit the <a href="http://tacosw.com/recoverlicense.php">Taco Software Recover License Code</a> page. You will need to provide the email that you used when you ordered Latexian, and your license code will be emailed to you. If you have any problems recovering your license code, <a href="support.html">contact Taco Software support</a>.
		</div>
		<div class="subsectiontitle"><a name="twocomputers"/>Can I use my Latexian license on two computers?</div>
		<div class="subsectioncontent">
			If there is only one person using Latexian, then you may use a single Latexian license on up to two computers. Please, purchase additional licenses if you are using more that two computers, or if there are multiple people using Latexian on more than one computer.
		</div>
		<div class="subsectiontitle"><a name="livepreview"/>Can Live Preview appear to the right of the text editor?</div>
		<div class="subsectioncontent">
			Yes, in the Preview section of Latexian's Preferences, select "Vertical" for the Text/Preview Divider option.
		</div>
		<div class="subsectiontitle"><a name="questionmarks"/>I see question marks where labels and references should appear in Preview and Live Preview. What should I do?</div>
		<div class="subsectioncontent">
			By default, Preview and Live Preview only do a single typesetter run without any options to maximize performance (Export does multiple runs).  You can configure Preview and Live Preview to do multiple runs and/or run BibTeX in the Preview section of Latexian's Preferences.  Then, your labels and references should appear.
