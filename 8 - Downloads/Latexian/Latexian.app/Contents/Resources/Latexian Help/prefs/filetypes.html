		Latexian determines a file's type based on the extension in a file's name. The file type affects how code coloring, code
		completion, and previewing is performed for a file. For example, Latexian will apply the BibTeX coloring rules to a file
		if the file's name ends with a BibTeX file extension, such as ".bib". The File Types section of the Preferences allows the file
		type associations to be customized, although the default values should work well for most people.<br /><br />
		File extensions can be removed and new ones added in the File Types Preferences. For each extension in the list, a file type
		must be specified from the following choices:
		<ul>
			<li>LaTeX: LaTeX rules for code coloring and code completion; LaTeX typesetter is used for preview and export.</li>
			<li>LaTeX (DVI): LaTeX rules for code coloring and code completion; the LaTeX typesetter is used to generate a DVI file, which is then converted to a PDF.</li>
			<li>XeTeX: The same as LaTeX, except the XeTeX typesetter is used for preview and export.</li>
			<li>BibTeX: BibTeX rules for code coloring and code completion.</li>
			<li>Plain Text: file will not be colored.</li>
		</ul><br />
		If a file in a project has an extension not listed in the File Types Preferences, then the file will open in the default external 
		application. If you would like such a file to open in Latexian, then add its extension in the Preferences, or you can also
		right-click the file in the project file browser and select "Open As Text". The File Types Preferences also allow you to specify the
		file type for new, untitled documents; once such a document is saved, it will use its file extension to determine its type.
