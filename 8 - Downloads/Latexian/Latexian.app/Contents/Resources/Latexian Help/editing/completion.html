			Latexian offers Code Completion for LaTeX and BibTeX content. Code Completion helps you to create documents
			with valid syntax, without having to constantly check reference documentation or to memorize a large vocabulary of
			keywords. In Latexian, there is a preference option that allows you to choose between having completions
			automatically suggested as you type or only having completions suggested when you choose the "Suggest Code 
			Completion" menu command. Code Completion can also suggest completions for Code Clips that you have setup. See 
			<a href="codeclips.html">Code Clips</a> for more information.

				Code Completion Preferences</a>
			</div>
			The Code Completion preferences are found in the "Editing" section of the Latexian Preferences. With these preferences, you can
			customize whether or not the Code Completion panel will automatically appear while you are editing text. A choice of "Automatic" will 
			mean that the panel appears automatically; "Manual" indicates that the panel will only appear when you select "Suggest Code Completion"
			from the "Syntax" menu (the keyboard shortcut is Command + Return).

				Code Completion Panel</a>
			</div>
			The Code Completion panel contains the suggested completions for the text you are editing. The top of the panel lists the suggested
			completions and includes info buttons that will access relevant documentation on the internet. The bottom of the panel contains a brief description
			of the currently selected completion. To use the currently selected completion, press Return. You can also double-click a completion
			to use it. The up and down arrow keys allow you to easily navigate the completion list.<br/><br/>
			In the completion list, items are sorted alphabetically, with the exception that <a href="codeclips.html">Code Clips</a> always appear after other completions at the end of the list.

		<div class="subsectiontitle"><a name="placeholder"/>Placeholders</div>
		<div class="subsectioncontent">
			Some completions, such as LaTeX commands with arguments, insert placeholders into the document to indicate where you need to add additional text (e.g.
			a value for a command argument). These placeholders appear like <img src="images/completionplaceholder.jpg" style="vertical-align:text-bottom;" height="16" width="129" border="0"/>. When placeholders are added
			to your document, use the "Select Next Placeholder" menu item from the "Syntax" menu to select the next placeholder. The keyboard
			shortcut for this command is Command + Single Quote.
