			Regular Expressions allow you to search for text using patterns. For example, in Latexian's Simple Regular Expressions,
			the asterisk (*) is treated as a wildcard character, so you could search for and select entire figures in an LaTeX document using the expression
			<code>\begin{figure}*\end{figure}</code>. Regular Expressions may be used for the find text on both the <a href="single.html">Single
			File Find</a> and the <a href="batch.html">Batch Find</a>. Also, in the Batch Find, Regular Expressions are used to specify a
			pattern for files to include in the search. Latexian has Preference options to select the type of Regular Expressions to
			use, from the following choices:
			<ul>
				<li>None: Find text is treated as a literal value with no pattern matching.</li>
				<li>Simple: The asterisk (*) may be used a wildcard character. It is a placeholder represents any number of any characters.</li>
				<li><a href="#advanced">Advanced</a>: The complete Ruby regular expression language may be used. Note that this means that there
				are several characters (e.g. <code>\</code>, <code>(</code>, <code>)</code>, etc.) that have special meanings.</li>
			</ul>

			If you select Advanced Regular Expressions in the Preferences, then you can use the complete Ruby Regular Expression language
			in your text searches. Below is a reproduction of the OgreKit documentation on the Ruby Regular Expression Language:
			<pre>
1. Syntax elements

  \       escape (enable or disable meta character meaning)
  |       alternation
  (...)   group
  [...]   character class  


2. Characters

  \t           horizontal tab (0x09)
  \v           vertical tab   (0x0B)
  \n           newline        (0x0A)
  \r           return         (0x0D)

  \M-\C-x      meta control char     (character code point value)

 (* \b is effective in character class [...] only)


3. Character types

  .        any character (except newline)

  \w       word character

           Not Unicode:
             alphanumeric, "_" and multibyte char. 

           Unicode:
             General_Category -- (Letter|Mark|Number|Connector_Punctuation)

  \W       non word char

  \s       whitespace char

           Not Unicode:
             \t, \n, \v, \f, \r, \x20

           Unicode:
             0009, 000A, 000B, 000C, 000D, 0085(NEL), 
             General_Category -- Line_Separator
                              -- Paragraph_Separator
                              -- Space_Separator

  \S       non whitespace char

  \d       decimal digit char

           Unicode: General_Category -- Decimal_Number

  \D       non decimal digit char

  \h       hexadecimal digit char   [0-9a-fA-F]

  \H       non hexadecimal digit char


4. Quantifier

  greedy

    ?       1 or 0 times
    *       0 or more times
    +       1 or more times
    {n,m}   at least n but not more than m times
    {n,}    at least n times
    {,n}    at least 0 but not more than n times ({0,n})
    {n}     n times

  reluctant

    ??      1 or 0 times
    *?      0 or more times
    +?      1 or more times
    {n,m}?  at least n but not more than m times  
    {n,}?   at least n times
    {,n}?   at least 0 but not more than n times (== {0,n}?)

  possessive (greedy and does not backtrack after repeated)

    ?+      1 or 0 times
    *+      0 or more times
    ++      1 or more times

    ({n,m}+, {n,}+, {n}+ are possessive op. in ONIG_SYNTAX_JAVA only)

    ex. /a*+/ === /(?&gt;a*)/


5. Anchors

  ^       beginning of the line
  $       end of the line
  \b      word boundary
  \B      not word boundary
  \A      beginning of string
  \Z      end of string, or before newline at the end
  \z      end of string
  \G      matching start position (*)

          * Ruby Regexp:
                 previous end-of-match position
                (This specification is not related to this library.)


6. Character class

  ^...    negative class (lowest precedence operator)
  x-y     range from x to y
  [...]   set (character class in character class)
  ..&&..  intersection (low precedence at the next of ^)
          
    ex. [a-w&&[^c-g]z] ==&gt; ([a-w] AND ([^c-g] OR z)) ==&gt; [abh-w]

  * If you want to use '[', '-', ']' as a normal character
    in a character class, you should escape these characters by '\'.


  POSIX bracket ([:xxxxx:], negate [:^xxxxx:])

    Not Unicode Case:

    alnum    alphabet or digit char
    alpha    alphabet
    ascii    code value: [0 - 127]
    blank    \t, \x20
    cntrl
    digit    0-9
    graph    include all of multibyte encoded characters
    lower
    print    include all of multibyte encoded characters
    punct
    space    \t, \n, \v, \f, \r, \x20
    upper
    xdigit   0-9, a-f, A-F


    Unicode Case:

    alnum    Letter | Mark | Decimal_Number
    alpha    Letter | Mark
    ascii    0000 - 007F
    blank    Space_Separator | 0009
    cntrl    Control | Format | Unassigned | Private_Use | Surrogate
    digit    Decimal_Number
    graph    [[:^space:]] && ^Control && ^Unassigned && ^Surrogate
    lower    Lowercase_Letter
    print    [[:graph:]] | [[:space:]]
    punct    Connector_Punctuation | Dash_Punctuation | Close_Punctuation |
             Final_Punctuation | Initial_Punctuation | Other_Punctuation |
             Open_Punctuation
    space    Space_Separator | Line_Separator | Paragraph_Separator |
             0009 | 000A | 000B | 000C | 000D | 0085
    upper    Uppercase_Letter
    xdigit   0030 - 0039 | 0041 - 0046 | 0061 - 0066
             (0-9, a-f, A-F)


7. Extended groups

  (?#...)            comment

  (?imx-imx)         option on/off
                         i: ignore case
                         m: multi-line (dot(.) match newline)
                         x: extended form
  (?imx-imx:subexp)  option on/off for subexp

  (?:subexp)         not captured group
  (subexp)           captured group

  (?=subexp)         look-ahead
  (?!subexp)         negative look-ahead
  (?&lt;=subexp)        look-behind
  (?&lt;!subexp)        negative look-behind

                     Subexp of look-behind must be fixed character length.
                     But different character length is allowed in top level
                     alternatives only.
                     ex. (?&lt;=a|bc) is OK. (?&lt;=aaa(?:b|cd)) is not allowed.

                     In negative-look-behind, captured group isn't allowed, 
                     but shy group(?:) is allowed.

  (?&gt;subexp)         atomic group
                     don't backtrack in subexp.

  (?&lt;name&gt;subexp)    define named group
                     (All characters of the name must be a word character.
                     And first character must not be a digit or uppper case)

                     Not only a name but a number is assigned like a captured
                     group.

                     Assigning the same name as two or more subexps is allowed.
                     In this case, a subexp call can not be performed although
                     the back reference is possible.


8. Back reference

  \n          back reference by group number (n &gt;= 1)
  \k&lt;name&gt;    back reference by group name

  In the back reference by the multiplex definition name,
  a subexp with a large number is referred to preferentially.
  (When not matched, a group of the small number is referred to.)

  * Back reference by group number is forbidden if named group is defined 
    in the pattern and ONIG_OPTION_CAPTURE_GROUP is not setted.


9. Subexp call ("Tanaka Akira special")

  \g&lt;name&gt;    call by group name
  \g&lt;n&gt;       call by group number (n &gt;= 1)

  * left-most recursive call is not allowed.
     ex. (?&lt;name&gt;a|\g&lt;name&gt;b)   =&gt; error
         (?&lt;name&gt;a|b\g&lt;name&gt;c)  =&gt; OK

  * Call by group number is forbidden if named group is defined in the pattern
    and ONIG_OPTION_CAPTURE_GROUP is not setted.

  * If the option status of called group is different from calling position
    then the group's option is effective.

    ex. (?-i:\g&lt;name&gt;)(?i:(?&lt;name&gt;a)){0}  match to "A"


10. Captured group

  Behavior of the no-named group (...) changes with the following conditions.
  (But named group is not changed.)

  case 1. /.../     (named group is not used, no option)

     (...) is treated as a captured group.

  case 2. /.../g    (named group is not used, 'g' option)

     (...) is treated as a no-captured group (?:...).

  case 3. /..(?&lt;name&gt;..)../   (named group is used, no option)

     (...) is treated as a no-captured group (?:...).
     numbered-backref/call is not allowed.

  case 4. /..(?&lt;name&gt;..)../G  (named group is used, 'G' option)

     (...) is treated as a captured group.
     numbered-backref/call is allowed.

  where
    g: ONIG_OPTION_DONT_CAPTURE_GROUP
    G: ONIG_OPTION_CAPTURE_GROUP

  ('g' and 'G' options are argued in ruby-dev ML)

  These options are not implemented in Ruby level.
