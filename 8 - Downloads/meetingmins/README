This class is adapted from Jim Hefferon's mins class (2005-Sept-01).
The goal of both of these classes is to produce minutes of meetings
quickly in an appealing printed format.  The principal difference
between this class and the mins class is that each section of the
document in this class is structured as a section rather than an
environment.  This structure is more intuitive when writing LaTeX
documents.  An additional feature of this class is that an agenda can
also be produced for distribution prior to the meeting, with certain
user-selected portions suppressed from printing.
