%	PRESS RELEASE CONTENT

%\begin{singlespace} % Uncomment for single line spacing

Paragraph one, with additional details about the announcement. The most important information goes in this paragraph.

Paragraph two goes here, with even more details about the announcement. Also included in this paragraph is a quote backing up the claims and statements above. Oftentimes there will be a quote from the CEO or other executives as well as a quote from customers or partners, depending on the nature of the announcement.

Paragraph three goes here and wraps it up, with details about pricing, availability, etc. After this paragraph include some standard boilerplate text for the company (see below). The entire release is designed to be one page long at most (ideally). Keep the length short and to the point because newswire services only allows a certain number of characters and then charges for additional. Every time you put out a release on the news wire you'll want to convert it into a PDF and put it on your website in a Press section in the company area as well - that way the content will get indexed by search engines and help your overall site ranking in search results.

Founded in 2013, XYZ company develops products that help customers XXX. Major customers of XYZ company include YYZ. XYZ company has offices in XXX and over XXX employees worldwide and is a leader in the XXX market. More information about XYZ Software can be found at www.abc.com.
